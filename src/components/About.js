        <p>My name is Kendra Gibson and I am a jack of all trades. I was born and raised in Houston, Texas. One major thing about me is that I am a huge animal nerd. I have always had pets in my life and will always work with them in some way. I also got a degree in Animal Science! I recently completed my certificate in computer programming as well.</p>
